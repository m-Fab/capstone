# Capstone Exchange Token Platform

This project is done by [Fabien Mauro](https://fmauro.eu). Currently running and ready to be used for testing [here](https://capstone.fmauro.eu).

## Note

This exchange is deployed on the [Goerli Testnet](https://goerli.etherscan.io/). It's purpose is for testing only.
If you need some Ether on Goerli testnet, you can use this [faucet](https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/) working with Facebook or Twitter.
You can also find other faucets [here](https://cryptomarketpool.com/ethereum-test-environments/).

## About

I created this app to learn how to develop on the Ethereum Blockchain and to showcase multiple function that I am able to create. This is mainly inspired by DeFi application that I often personaly use with MetaMask like Aave, PancakeSwap, 1Inch etc...
